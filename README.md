## Methods
### Introduction
Each methods have access modifiers. Methods can be static or non static. 
For method Name we can use camel case as the standard. 
Method signature is the method name along with its parameters. 
The reason that the access modifier not contain in the signature is due to overloading. 

### Parameter in Methods
Pass by value and Pass by reference are the methods that can be used for passing values to the method.

### 4 principles of OOP (Object Orented Programming)
#### Encapsulation
Wrapping the data and code acting on the data(methods) together as a single unit. 
The variables of a class will be hidden from other classes and can be accessed only through the methods of their current class. Therefore it is also known as data hiding. 
Getters and Setters are used.
#### Inheritance
#### Plymorphism
#### Abstraction
